# Personal Website

This website is my first project using [React](https://react.dev/), a popular JavaScript library designed for creating fast, dynamic, and interactive web applications. React enables pages to update instantly without full reloads, delivering a smoother and more responsive experience that feels more like a native app than a traditional website.

The project is also written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), which enforces type safety and helps catch potential issues during development. By leveraging TypeScript, the codebase remains reliable, scalable, and easier to maintain over time.

Version control and collaboration are handled through [GitHub](https://github.com/) as you can probably tell... where every update is tracked and organized. Once changes are committed, they are deployed automatically via [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), a platform optimized for hosting modern web applications with speed, reliability, and continuous delivery.

Together, these technologies create a website that is:

- âš¡ Fast and responsive
- ðŸ“± Fully mobile-friendly
- ðŸ§¹ Clean and scalable in its codebase
- ðŸš€ Optimized for performance and future growth
